>BANK LOAN DATA CASE STUDY

The case study involved an in-depth analysis of a loan dataset to examine factors influencing loan default rates. The dataset was meticulously explored, considering variables such as geographic location, credit score, loan purpose, and home ownership type. The study aimed to uncover patterns and associations within the data to better understand the risk factors leading to loan defaults. Key findings included regional disparities, correlations between credit scores and default rates, and the impact of home ownership on loan repayment. The insights generated from this study can be invaluable for lenders and policymakers in formulating strategies to minimize loan defaults and enhance risk management.

## Conclusions
- In the case study, it was conclusively demonstrated that California exhibited the highest loan default rate among all states, while Idaho had notably lower default rates. This divergence in default rates signifies a critical disparity in the creditworthiness and financial stability of borrowers in these two states, warranting further investigation and potential policy considerations.

- it became evident that the loan term, whether short or long, did not significantly influence the default rate. Remarkably, both short and long-term loans exhibited a similar default rate. This suggests that other factors, such as borrower creditworthiness or economic conditions, may play a more substantial role in determining loan default rates. Further analysis is essential to understand the underlying causes.

- The analysis reveals that the type of home ownership significantly impacts loan default rates. Particularly, homes categorized as "RENT" (with a code of 2) and "MORTGAGE" (with a code of 3) show notably higher default rates. This association suggests that individuals residing in rented or mortgaged homes are more susceptible to loan defaults, possibly due to increased financial commitments. Further exploration of this trend is warranted to develop targeted strategies for risk mitigation in these specific homeownership categories, especially when coupled with high 

- An analysis of the relationship between loan purposes and loan default rates revealed a noteworthy trend. Loans allocated for home-related expenses and credit card utilization consistently exhibited higher default rates. This observation underscores the need for a closer examination of the factors contributing to increased default risk in these specific loan categories, possibly prompting lenders to adapt their risk assessment and lending strategies accordingly.
